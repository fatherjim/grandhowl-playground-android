## About project

Project Platform is a proprietary events management platform, written in Kotlin.

The development of the Project Platform is mostly done by Project employees with an open development model.

The source code, documentation, roadmap, issue tracker, testing, benchmarks are all public.

Typically, Project users build different types of information management solutions for [document management](http://), [case management](http://), and [digital asset management](http://), use cases. It uses schema-flexible metadata & content models that allows content to be repurposed to fulfill future use cases.

More information is available at [www.project.com](http://).
